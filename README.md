## Tools & AI Engines

This application leverages a suite of advanced AI tools and engines to deliver futuristic healthcare solutions.

### Genkit AI
The core of our generative AI capabilities is powered by Google's Genkit. It orchestrates AI flows, manages prompts, and integrates with large language models to provide features like:
- **AI-Assisted Diagnostics:** Analyzing medical images and reports.
- **Automated Summaries:** Generating concise summaries of patient records and communications.
- **Intelligent Chatbots:** Powering conversational assistants for patients, doctors, and hospital staff.

### Predictive Models
Machine learning models are used across the platform to forecast health events and operational needs:
- **Stroke Prediction Hub:** A real-time model that analyzes patient vitals to predict stroke risk up to 6 hours in advance.
- **Cardiac Device Monitoring:** AI predicts potential failures in implanted cardiac devices like pacemakers and ICDs.
- **Hospital Operations:** AI predicts patient load, staff burnout risk, and potential resource shortages.

### Chatbots
The application features specialized AI chatbots for each user role, providing contextual assistance and automating tasks:
- **Patient Chatbot:** Helps book appointments, set reminders, and answer health queries.
- **Doctor Chatbot:** Assists with clinical tasks like summarizing patient info and checking schedules.
- **Hospital Chatbot:** Helps administrators manage bed capacity, resolve incidents, and act on surge alerts.

### Smart IoT Integrations
The platform is designed to connect with and process data from a variety of smart IoT devices:
- **Wearables:** The "Smart Devices" hub syncs with watches and bands to monitor live health metrics like heart rate, SpO2, and sleep patterns.
- **Implanted Devices:** The Cardiac ASI Hub continuously monitors telemetry data from pacemakers, ICDs, and LVADs.

### Analytics Engines
Dashboards across the application are powered by robust analytics engines that process and visualize complex data:
- **Patient Analytics:** Visualizes vital sign trends, medication compliance, and future health risks.
- **Hospital Analytics:** Tracks KPIs like patient load, revenue, and departmental performance.
- **Blood Bank Analytics:** Provides insights into donor demographics and monthly donation trends.
